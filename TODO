* Bring over various trivial but useful command-line programs:
	cal
	calendar
	date
	diff
	echo
	ed
	hoc

* Libdraw
	- should implement the alt sequences for unicode composition
	  the code is in drawterm, just needs to be pulled in.
	- snarf code doesn't work on mac os?

* Plumber
	- need to redefine how you find and talk to the plumber,
	  probably using named pipes or unix sockets.
	- hook samterm up to the plumber
	- now trivial to plumb to web browser!

* 9term
	- would be great to have a 9term lookalike that was 
	  a little more faithful (or, better, like acme win)

* Acme
	- once have a plumber, might not be too hard to
	  redo the file system interface as a text rpc
	  over unix domain sockets.
	- until then, the x11 "ion" window manager is an
	  interesting half-way point.  perhaps it makes
	  more sense to split acme's editing into tightly
	  coupled separate programs (perhaps communicating
	  via the plumber?) and then have acme be
	  a window manager a bit like ion?

* Mail
	- no ideas here

* Venti
	- server port is in progress (actually done, but with an 
	  earlier library set).
	- vac is easy to port
	- need way to mount vacs.  have all the code for a /vac file
	  system (e.g., cd /vac/68b329da9893e34099c7d8ad5cb9c940da9393e3)
	  but need to put it together.

* Dump
	- have a dump file system that sits on the side of ffs,
	  backing up disk images to venti.  a loopback NFS server
	  serves the backed-up images.  
	  needs cleanup and release.  should be easy to add ext2,
	  fat.  ntfs harder but possible.
