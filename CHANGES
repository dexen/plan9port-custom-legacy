March 25, 2004

	Change putenv not to free the string after calling real putenv.
	Apparently BSDs copy the string but Linux and others use the
	one you pass in.

	Add Indent command to acme listing.  Reported by Rob Pike.

	Define clock to plumbclock in plumber/fsys.c to avoid name clash on SunOS.
	Reported by Axel Belinfante and Markus Friedl.

	Expanded NOTES to discuss CVS some more.

	Change one instance of ulong in rio to unsigned long.

	Tweak SunOS ps from Axel Belinfante.

	Change diff not to mention the dirty word "stdout" anymore.
	Reported by Taj Khattra et al.

	Change 9l to add -lpthread on OpenBSD.
	Reported by Markus Friedl.

	Change 9l to add -Rfoo for each -Lfoo on the command line
	on SunOS.  Avoids need to maintain LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
	Reported by Axel Belinfante.

	#define time to p9time in libc.h for systems where time_t != long (OpenBSD).
	Reported by Markus Friedl.

	Add SHAPE support and bitmapped grey background back to rio.
	Reported by Markus Friedl.

	Add various OpenBSD-specific files from Markus Friedl.

	Change rcmain to use "test" rather than "/bin/test" to accomodate
	systems where test is in /usr/bin.   Reported by Sam.

	Silence "unknown id '' in attach" message from acme.
	There are just more attaches than there were in Plan 9, and not
	all of them are for windows.

	Change 9term to handle "send" a little better.

	Add grep.  Reported by Taj Khattra.

	Split lib9.h into u.h and libc.h, so that programs can
	include u.h, then unix headers, then libc.h.  Then changed
	lib9 to do this.
	Fixes many warnings on SunOS reported by Axel Belinfante.

	Change 9term not to misfree when plumbing empty string.
	Fix reported by Taj Khattra.

	Fix threadexecl to process vararg list with va_list etc. rather 
	than using &f+1.  The &f+1 trick fails on SunOS.  Reported by
	Axel Belinfate.

	Change x11-init to handle SunOS 24-bit colormapped screen
	properly?  Fix reported by Axel Belinfante.  Let's just play along.

	Add awd.  Suggested by Sam.

	9term no longer aborts without plumber.

	Remove _p9translate from guts of various calls.
	Instead, callers who want #9 or #d paths explicitly call unsharp
	to translate them.

	Added ^F completion to 9term.

	Change win to use a real pty, so that things like rubout work.

	Change 9term, win to handle rubout even when output
		is streaming in.
