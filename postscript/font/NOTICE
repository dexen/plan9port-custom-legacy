This directory is intended to contain the same files
as in /sys/lib/postscript/font in a Plan 9 distribution,
including the Lucida Sans Unicode font from B&H.  
The terms of the font license in Plan 9 do not permit 
us to distribute those files here.

As a substitute for the Lucida Sans fonts, 
Plan 9 from User Space provides Luxi Sans,
also by B&H but available under a more liberal
license, and Deja Vu, a Unicode extension of the
Bitstream Vera family of fonts.

Luxi Sans is similar to Lucida Sans except that
it has no Unicode support.  Deja Vu does have 
good Unicode support.
