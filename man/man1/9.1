9 \- run Plan 9 commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 9
.I cmd

.B 9
.SH DESCRIPTION
Because Plan 9 supplies commands with the same name as but different
behavior than many basic Unix system commands
(e.g.,
.BR grep ,
.BR sed ,
.BR mkdir ,
.BR rm ),
it is not recommended to run with the Plan 9 bin directory
ahead of the system directories.
.PP
.I 9
is a shell script that sets up a Plan 9 environment and runs
.I cmd .
It sets
.B $PLAN9
and adds
.B $PLAN9/bin
to the beginning of
.B $PATH
before running
.IR cmd .
.PP
If run with no arguments,
.B 9
does not do anything.  This is so that it can be invoked from
.IR sh -style
shells using
.B .
.B 9
in order to make the current shell start running in the Plan 9 environment.
