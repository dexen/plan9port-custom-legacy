.SH DESCRIPTION
The master source tree for Plan 9 from User Space is maintained
using the source control system Mercurial
as a substitute for Plan 9's
\fIreplica\fR(8) and dump file system.
(It is maintained simultaneously using CVS; see
.IR cvs (1).)
.PP
The first argument to
.I hg
is a command, which determines the form of the rest of the command line.
.PP
The
.B clone
command downloads a copy of the tree into the directory
.BR plan9 ,
which it will create.
After
.B hg
.BR clone ,
the other commands listed 
should be run within the
.B plan9
directory tree.
.PP
Unlike CVS, Mercurial downloads the entire revision history
of Plan 9 from User Space 
in addition to the current tree.
.PP
.I Hg
.I pull
incorporates changes from the master repository
into the local revision history.
The 
.B -u
flag applies these changes to the current file tree.
.PP
.I Hg
.I diff
runs Unix's
.IR diff (1)
to compare the files in the local tree with the corresponding
files in the revision history.
By default it compares against the version that was most recently
incorporated into the local tree.
The
.B -r
flag specifies an alternate version to compare against.
The special revision
.B tip
refers to the most recent version on the server.
.PP
.I Hg
.I serve
starts an HTTP server serving information about
the local repository at the address
.BR http://localhost:8000/ .
.PP
.I Hg
.I view
starts an interactive history viewer.
.PP

.SH BUGS
The use of Mercurial for accessing Plan 9 from User Space
should be considered experimental.
People uncomfortable with Mercurial should continue to use
.IR cvs (1).
